Some utilities for great Lift framework. 

Currently contains SecurityUtils, that extend Lift's SecurityHelpers with Blowish and 3DES encrypting and decrypting funtions. 
These were removed from Lift due to being vulnerable by using predictable IVs. I've changed that and use IVs generated by SecureRandom.

Any suggestions and improvements are greatly apprecitated.
